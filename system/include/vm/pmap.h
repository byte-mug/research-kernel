 * an virtual address space. However, Whereas the kernel is technically mapped into
 * every virtual address space, the kernel address space is represented by a single,
 * special and unique 'pmap_t'-instance. All changes to the kernel address space, and
 * all operations to the kernel's 'pmap_t'-instance SHALL be visible to all individual
 * virtual address spaces.
 *
 * The kernel resides in the upper half of the available address range, and SHALL BE
 * accessible from the kernel mode (aka. supervisor mode) only (unless there is no usable
 * hardware protection). It SHALL BE shared and identical across all virtual address spaces.
 * The lower half of the available address range SHALL BE accessible from user mode.
