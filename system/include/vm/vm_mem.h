/*
 * Management for resident Memory
 *
 * A small structure is kept for each resident segment: 'vm_mem_t'. The structure
 * contains a reference to the memory itself (eighter a page-address,
 * a vm_page_t object or a vm_range_t object), as well as the sundry status bits.
 *
 * Fields in this structure are locked either by the lock on the segment that the
 * vm_mem_t belongs to.
 *
 * Legend:
 *  (B) : 'vm_bstore_t' aka. "backing storage"
 *  (f) : this information is determined by page-faults and possibly a false
 *        negative.
 *  (x) : provided, the platform supports executable space protection.
